# This file controls which biomes and block replacements are added.
# Every line starting with a # is a comment and will be ignored by the mod. 
# 
## HOW TO USE THIS CONFIG FILE
# 
# ADDING AND REMOVING BIOMES
# You can add and remove biomes from the list of biomes, which may spawn villages.
# The line '+b:Name' adds the biome named 'Name' to the list, the line '-b:Name' removes it.
# 
# You can also add or remove all biomes with a specific tag, by writing '+t:TAG' or '-t:TAG',
# where 'TAG' is one of the following tags:
# FOREST, PLAINS, MOUNTAIN, HILLS, SWAMP, WATER, DESERT, FROZEN, JUNGLE, WASTELAND, BEACH, NETHER, END, MUSHROOM, MAGICAL
# Each biome has one or several tags, theseare added by the creators of the respective biome mods.
#
# Please note that deletions are processed after additions.
# 
# BLOCK REPLACEMENTS 
# To replace a block in village generation, you write
#  ~original_block_name,replacement_block_name:metadata,target_biome
# where
#  - original_block_name and replacement_block_name are the unlocalized names of the
#      original and the replacement blocks. For vanilla block names consult
#      http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block_ids#Block_IDs
#  - metadata is an integer in the range of 0 to 15 and the data value the replacement block
#      should have. For metadata of vanilla blocks consult
#      http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block_ids#Data
#  - target_biome, is either 'b:Name' or 't:TAG' as explained above.
#
# For stair block and slabs it is advisable not to change the data value, as that would mess up their
# orientation. To keep the original data value, you omit the metadata part and just write
#  ~original_block_name,replacement_block_name,target_biome
