        "§lDay one§r\n A small group of hunters myself included have just been sent out to defend a village and, if possible, launch an attack on the nearby vampire forest. Being new at hunting vampires I was a little nervous, but Marcus, another hunter reassured me.",
        "§lNight one§r\n Not much happened tonight, a few vampires were spotted but none came close. They seemed to eye the villagers but retreated upon seeing our weapons. I'm still not sure why we have to use these axes specifically, Marcus just told me that the vampires don't die easily and that these just put them down quicker but never a solid reason. I'll try out another weapon if I ever get the chance.",
        "§lNight two§r\n I'm skipping making day entries as nothing of note ever happens, I will however mention that I bought a plain iron sword off of one of the local blacksmiths. A few vampires attacked, there were no losses but one did manage to bite a villager. Unsurprisingly they went down quick and weren't much to handle.",
        "§lNight three§r\n This night was bad. There was a small attack staged by a group of vampires on the village, I was given the opportunity so I dealt with one only with my iron sword. I now understand why Marcus told me to use these axes, after a few moments it's limbs regrew and it literally got back up! Something about these axes being salted or holy keeps them from regenerating. After dispatching it with my axe I returned to my group to see a strange vampire exit the forest slowly, she seemed different. Not only was she dressed in fine almost royal garments but she seemed to walk with confidence. I would later learn this was one of the \"barons\" of the forest, a type of much stronger vampire that seems to enthrall others to their will. After a moment of pause the others charged her. To this day I do not think I will forget what I saw that night, Rutherd was first to go. He went in for a swipe of his axe, effortlessly she seemed to avoid the hit and backhanded him. With that single hit he had been sent back, his flimsy leather torn easily as his cheekbone seemed to break from the hit. The others backed up, a smiled seemed to form on her face. Marcus then charged with Alex, a sort of scissor attack going on on both sides. To our sudden horror the baron just vanished into straight air, or so we had thought. Horror turned to fear as we had learned the hard way that this one could turn herself invisible. Alex's axe was suddenly knocked from his hand as the now invisible baron latched onto his neck with her fangs, he would have died from blood loss if Marcus didn't step in and attack her with his axe. A sudden shriek was heard as she let go of Alex and swiped at Marcus, which he blocked with the blade of his axe. Whatever wound he had inflicted didn't seem to heal, when her hit was blocked by his axe blade her hand seemed almost burned. A look of fear went across her face as it dawned on her that she was very much so viable to die. I charged in from behind, a small stake in hand. I'd have slew her if she hadn't suddenly grown claws and large wings that quite literally slammed into me. As I was knocked on the ground from the sheer impact of these wings. Alex ran to attack with Rutherd who had healed with the use of one of our potions, The baron swiped at Alex while simultaneously using her wings to slam into Rutherd and defend her backside. Suddenly, Marcus had pulled a vial of holy water with the label \"ultimate\". While the baron was about to decapitate Alex Marcus threw it at her. The sound she made was terrible, a loud hiss that rang in ears disorientating us. Her flesh was horribly burned and started to fall off her body, while writhing in pain I quickly got up and drove my axe deep into her skull. With that she crumpled to the ground, and this night was over.",
        "§lDay four§r\n After our attack against the baron we were moved back to HQ and put up in the hospital. Some other team was sent in out place."

      "author": "Unknown",
      "content": [
        "He used to be normal. Respected, admired, and rich beyond anyone's imaginations, but one by one, everyone in his life left him. It began when he came back from visiting his sister, who lived farther south in a much larger city than this small village. Upon receiving news that she had been attacked, he raced off into the night, hoping to be at her bedside when she died. When he returned, gone was the man we once knew. He shut himself away in his mansion, firing half of his staff, keeping on only those he trusted, and for some reason, me. The mansion felt cold and lifeless, and this feeling only grew as it fell into disrepair. Over time, everyone started to quit, traveling to the city in search of a better paying job, but I stayed, among the cobwebs and layers of dust, and did the best I could to care for the house and its inhabitant. I began to notice strange behavioral changes. I'd often find him performing strange rituals in the dead of night, making sure all curtains were shut in the daytime, and he began to look... hungrier. Everyday I would prepare his dinner, but each night he would stare with increasing disdain. For a while he would attempt to eat the food, but he at some point he stopped, instead just glaring at the dish with a sense of rage, and a bit of sadness. One day, I decided to skip making dinner for him. He never ate it anyways, and I had better things to do with my time, but as the clock struck nine, he suddenly appeared in the doorway of my small room. \"Dinner. Now\" he demanded, with a hungry look in his eyes. So terrifying was his demeanor, it was like his eyes shone red in the dark. He stalked off, and I immediately raced off to the kitchen. With shaking hands, I prepared his meal, as he sat deadly still at the head of the dinner table. The fire roared, and the room had grown hot, but his face was like that of a corpse. Pale, devoid of all blood. His eyes seemed sunken, lifeless like the home we stood in. Overcome with my thoughts, my hand slipped, and my kitchen knife cut into my palm. I quickly grabbed a hand towel to stop the bleeding, but the knife had cut deep. \"Maid! Where is my meal?\" he yelled from the dining room. Shaking, with the hand towel still wrapped around my wound, I picked up the plate, gathered his silverware, and entered the room. As soon as I entered, he stiffened. \"Have you prepared something new today?\" he asked in a gentle voice. I froze, \"No sir. It's what you always request. Steak... rare.\" He stared at me, then smiled a little. I could swear I saw beast-like teeth, glistening in the candle light. \"Put it down on the table\" he said, in a low growl, as he stood up and began making his way towards me. Nervous, I took a step back, and with that, he began to speed up. His shadow grew, lengthened by the roaring fire behind him, and as it reached me, I turned and darted into the kitchen. The plate shattered behind me, as I threw open the doors and looked for a place to hide. I quickly grabbed the kitchen knife I had cut myself with, and ducked behind the counter. The doors flew open, slamming into the walls and knocking over a broom I had left standing there. I peered around the corner to see him standing there, hungrily in the doorway. \"I can smell your blood. It's quite sweet, and I haven't eaten in so long...\" he whispered as he stalked into the room. I looked down in horror at my hand, with blood still seeping through the cloth. Suddenly, he slammed his hands onto the counter, and stared menacingly at me from above. I tried to move out of the way, but he grabbed my hair and slammed my head onto the counter. \"You know...\" he started, gazing hungrily at me, \"I've tried drinking from rats, from the chickens, even from the neighbors damn dog, but they've never been able to satisfy my thirst. A human though? The world can always do with one less of you.\" Disoriented, I struggled to move as he slowly sunk his teeth into my neck. It was terrible as I felt the blood drawn out of my body. I could feel myself becoming weaker, but I managed to raise my knife and plunge it into his chest. Gasping, he backed away, coughing up the very blood he had just been drinking, and crumpled to the ground. I watched him die in horror, as I realized that I was now a murderer. It may have been in self defense, but no one would ever believe me. I stood frozen in shock, and just as I could no longer bear to watch him succumb to death, I saw it. The monster began to stir. It seemed that he had hung in a state between life and death, until his powers brought him back to life. As he started to move, I knew what I had to do. Steadying myself, I took my knife, still red with blood, and aimed directly at his heart. The knife sunk deep, and with one final look of rage, the light faded from his eyes, and at last he was at peace. Stepping away, I began to plan my next move. I was just a lowly maid, who was now left with the corpse of an aristocrat. He may not have been loved in his final moments, but that didn't take away his power. I would likely be hung for my crimes. I wasn't dead yet though. I still had time to escape before his body was found. I looked down at my dress, now soaked in his blood, and went to my room to pack everything I had. I had to leave in the dead of night to avoid suspicion. I had been locked away in this mansion for so long, I was sure it would have been a shock to see me in the town, much less in a blood-soaked dress. I didn't have much, so all I took with me was a small suitcase. I made sure to change my outfit to avoid suspicion, but still brought with me my now soiled dress. I would have to find a place to wash out the stains, but it was the only other outfit I owned. I couldn't afford to leave it behind, nor could I let someone else find it and start tracking me down. I began to feel lethargic, but I blamed it on the blood loss I had just suffered. I couldn't believe all this time, I had been living in the same home as a vampire. I had only read stories about them, these terrible creatures that came in the dead of night, to drain you of life. I was terrified to realize they exist, a nightmare come true. Once I found a safe place, I vowed to find a way to protect myself from these beasts. I left the house, armed with the knife that had saved my life, my suitcase, and a coat, for I had begun to feel extremely cold despite the warm summer breeze. I made my way towards the docks, determined to make it aboard a ship and travel as far as I could from this hell."

        "I've been wandering for a few days now, each day the whispers seem to grow louder and clearer? I feel a greater desire to find whatever is making it..I'm not even sure why i'm still walking- its just something tells me I need to keep going this way, maybe god is trying to save me?",

        "I have been with the prince for 10 years now. He arrived to this forest a weak creature, stumbling around on the search for blood, when he discovered this was a place for creatures like him. I didn't pay much attention to him at first. Newly turned, he wasn't yet strong enough to take on the barons that dominated this land, so he kept to himself most of the time. I had other things to worry about, like the hunters that often wandered in to take our blood and souls. Everything changed however, when he took down the first baron. It wasn't the strongest one, ranked fairly low in our hierarchy, but from then on he was seen as a threat. He started collecting the pureblood of the barons, using it in strange rituals in the dead of night, where a red beam would shoot down towards him, bathing the vampire in a crimson light. At first I feared him and his curious ways, but after a while I started to admire his power. After spending time in our forest and growing in strength, he soon became known as Lord. The hunters of the nearby village had heard of his power, and arrived often to take down this dark threat in their lives. He always persevered, but in this world he was without allies. That is, until he approached me. Handing me a scroll, he asked me to join him. Speaking of the turmoil and hardships that vampires like him faced, he said that he wished to grow stronger, and protect the vampires of this forest. I quickly agreed, and found myself under the leadership of this fierce vampire. He gave me weapons, armor, even a name. Before this I had lost all focus, aimlessly wandering around, searching only for blood and fighting any that stood in my way, but now I had a purpose. He soon gathered more followers, those that worked towards the same purpose as him, and became known as the Prince of these dark lands. One night he gestured for me to follow him, and led me to a chest. He spoke in a whisper, ensuring none would overhear what he would say next. \"As my most trusted minion, I would like to show you something.\" Turning, he opened the chest and pulled out a cloak and a bottle of pureblood. Quickly, he threw the cloak around his shoulders, and uncorked the bottle. Lifting the pureblood to his lips, he drained it, and from his back something monstrous grew. Crimson wings unfurled behind him, and stretched out as my Prince stood tall. He laughed at the look of shock on my face. \"Don't worry, these are just temporary\" he said. \"They will disappear in a few minutes. I discovered this effect during my experiments.\" My shock turned to amazement, as I reveled in how much we still didn't know about our own species. \"I've been working in secret on how we can continue to improve ourselves. I can assure you, these wings are just the start of uncovering how powerful we can become.\" He soon left the room, leaving me to take in this amazing new discovery. One day we would leave this dark forest and bring a new era to the world. I'm not sure yet what this will entail, but I am confident that with my Prince leading the vampires of this land, we can take on any obstacle that dares stand in our way."

        "It started months ago. People in my village have always led a peaceful life, but recently a new person moved to town. He was a strange fellow, only emerging from his house at night and rarely talking to the townsfolk. He seemed shifty, but I really started to keep an eye on him when his neighbor's livestock were drained, left in the fields devoid of blood. That night he seemed energized, stronger than usual. I began to watch him after the sun set, often forgoing sleep in favor of finding out what he was up to. Like clockwork, he would emerge from his house as the sun was setting and disappear into the shadows. Sometimes I could have sworn his eyes glowed red as he set off into the night. He looked human but felt... off. After a few weeks in town, he began to get visitors late at night. They would often come weak-looking and tired, but leave refreshed, with bottles full of a red liquid. As time went on the livestock in the surrounding area slowly died. When found, they would be completely drained, with 2 puncture ones somewhere on their body. People began to suspect there was a monster in the nearby forest, but I knew the truth. That man was somehow behind this. One morning, a farmer awoke me, claiming that the monster had attacked, but one cow survived. He claimed the animal had become violent, and it's eyes had grown blood red. He led me to the barn, where he had trapped the creature, and I decided that it was time to figure out this mystery. The next night, very carefully, I took the cow and put it in a nearby shed. I began my experiments. Learning what this creature was consumed my nights, and I soon grew careless. The man who lived in town was no longer being watched, and was out of livestock. Without a nearby source of blood, he soon moved to the townspeople. I paid no attention, and one by one, these people disappeared. Some would return, but they were different, often staying inside their houses until the sun had set. The town was empty, but it became alive at night. I ignored the loud yelling I often heard, assuming everything was okay. As I worked, I found the cow was susceptible to some things. It often became weak when in contact with water, or near garlic. It became sluggish and weak, but it didn't harm it. I needed something to defeat the creature that had moved to my town. Finally, I came upon my solution. Fire. One flame and the cow ignited, quickly burning to ashes. I had lost my test subject, but gained a new weapon. I went to bed that night satisfied with my work, but woke up to screams only minutes later. I grabbed my flint and steel and rushed out the door to help. Emerging from my house I tripped and crashed to the ground. To my horror. I had tripped over the body of my neighbor, a small old woman who lived alone with her dog. I was aghast. Who could have done such a thing? She was an innocent person who would never harm a soul. I found my answer as I looked up, seeing that strange man approach. His eyes glowed red as he licked the blood from his sharp, pointed teeth. \"Surprised?\" he said, drawing closer, eyes locked on me. Behind him, I saw once familiar faces now distorted, desperately searching for blood. This town was dead, and I was the only human remaining. With my flint and steel in hand, I knew what I had to do. The undead creature dove for me, but I hit him away and ran off into the night. I soon arrived to an abandoned building in the middle of town, and set it ablaze. The flame grew unbearably hot, but all I could do was watch the fire grow larger, and consume the town I once knew and loved. I would make them all burn. These creatures that consumed our livelihood, our people, everything in our lives. I would make them pay. The fire quickly spread, burning the demonic creatures until there were only ashes remaining. I left my home that night with only my flint and steel, but I will stop at nothing to make these vampires burn."

        "§lEntry 1:§r I have been hired to accompany a group of \"vampire\" hunters into one of those dark forests that seem to appear randomly, I am to take notes of what we see. I am unsure what they're expecting to find, but they're paying good money. We will journey there in the morning.",
        "§lEntry 2:§r I must admit I am finding this place remarkable, its almost as if the very plants suck the life from the soil; sharp thorns and alarmingly jagged bark. Oddly, I keep hearing this quiet voice, calling to me. Singing in my head, drawing me deeper into the woods. When I asked the \"hunters\" if they heard the same they just nodded, and told me \"not to follow it\".",
        "§lEntry 3:§r A lot has happened, most importantly, I think I am a believer now. We were attacked by a group of what I thought were other people only to discover extremely sharp teeth, glowing red eyes, alarming speed, and what seems to be regenerative properties? The hunters dispatched them quickly using these strange axes that seemed to almost burn the vampires flesh when made contact. ",
        "§lEntry 4:§r Some strange vampire wearing large extravagant almost royal black clothes stepped out from behind a tree, with a smile and a snap of her fingers a large group of vampires, like zombies, came upon us. The hunters did their best but for every vampire felled another took its place, again, and again, until finally only one hunter remained. The vampire woman, of whom I shall refer to as \"The lady\" simple smiled and stepped forth. Before he could take a swing she had stabbed her hand through his chest, taking his heart out and eating it. Then, as she turned to me, another vampire almost exactly like her had walked over and started hisssing loudly. Another finely dressed vampire had come forth, this time male. She hissed back, her entire eye turning blood red as she wings started to grow from her back and claws from her hands. The other vampire did the same. The two leapt at each other, delivering grievous wounds that seemed to close faster than they could be made. Finally the male had gotten the upper hand, stepping behind her and piercing her heart with his claws. She paused for the moment, taking shallow breaths. As he pulled her heart out she seemed to melt, her blood spilling out onto the grass. The man had suddenly turned on me, but before he could rip me to pieces, another hunter had arrived. Bearing strange all black armor, and a menacing black axe; he fought the man. Before long the hunter won, and planted the axe deep into his head. The man also froze, taking deep breaths, trying to pull the axe from his head. To no avail, for he too melted into a puddle of blood.",
        "§lEntry 5:§r I don't quite remember what happened afterwards. I simply woke up in a village church, one of the village priests tending to me. The hunter whom had saved my life sitting beside me, reading a letter. After asking how I had come to such a position, he simply told me \"Her voice had gotten to you, you tried to attack me.\" and no more. I will be taking my pay and never going near one of those forests again."

        "§lInsights to the history: The century of evolution§r\n§oProcessed version – the piece remains updated with new theories and findouts by present experts to keep the educational value of the discriptive texts on the matter§r\n\nIt is supposed to have started circa 300 years ago, when humanity decided to hunt witches in big numbers.\nI don't exactly know why, but I would presume that it was caused by some deep, intelectual farmer debate.\n\nHumans never had any paramount government, but between the villages, which were spread relatively close to each other, news were traveling quite quicky.\n\nThe witches were naturally in a great disadvantage agaist humanity and their numbers were decreasing even further. And therefore, they tried to bargain. They promised that if the chase will cease once for all, they will make humankind more powerful than memory can reach.\nBased on some diary pages and other historical artifacts I have collected on my travels, there is little doubt that the witches did not actually know what they were doing and the promise of marvelous powers was a spontaneous attempt to save their bare skin, a desperate boast, without a proper idea of what to actually do for humanity.\nWhen I think about it now, it makes sense. Why would they develop and keep in store a way to give such powers to humanity? And not use it on themselves in the first place?\nNow that we know what it really was, the answer could be obvious... but I doubt they would be that morale...\nAnd they never explained how it works before they started to prepare their rituals. So even I have a feeling that they might have improvised.\nWell, with a very short thinking, the folk accepted that offer, of course. Even when I doubt that everyone has agreed, especially after they later found out, how it works. Clearly the oblivious majority was fine with it, arranged everything and festively promised to leave witches alone.\n\nThey still lived alone in their huts or wandered through the world afterwards, strictly unaccepting and immediately attacking humans. But finding them today is not so dangerous, I have heard that witches of today are only a shadow of what they were before. I do not know if that is true, but they in fact do not seem capable of actions their ancestors were. Perhaps their power was in their united efforts.\nWhen the agreement had spread through more villages, the witches started working on their side of the arrangement. They all united, which they have never done ever after. They used their dark arts and with connected force they casted an ultimate spell into the core of human nature.\n\nOnce they had described how exactly it works, some were asking them to remove it again, but they replied that even if they would want to, they doubt it is even possible. Some were killed, but almost everyone fleed their own way before we, humans, could actually do something. Even if we actually could have.\nI personally think that from the very start it was just an attempt for revenge. That the witches have done it all from a presumption that it will lead humanity into self-destruction.\n\nThe witches explained to humans, that when an individual of their race is exposed to long-term extreme stress and chased to the edge of their strenght and life, there is a certain small chance that the spell will take action. But this person will only serve as a wellhead of power to others, he himself will not have basically any. Paradoxly, of Them, he will be the strongest.\n\nAnother dark age came forth to humanity by that time. Time, when power-hungry radicals tortured the ones they were supposed to look after or that they kidnapped, and then chased them starved into the woods for monsters to take, hoping they will Transmutate and tgive them the promised power.\n\nWhen the Transmutation does actually happen, the mentioned near-dead individual changes himself into a giant kind of lightly blue mass of flesh. It then grows with a site of thin, hair-like \"roots\" into the ground, similar to the mushroom mycelium, and starts to suck life from the surrounding lands and from everything standing on it. The ground around becomes infected and a mist starts to come out of it, as if the earth was breathing it out... it covers the sunrays which are deadly to everything of this nature...\nEverything that is born on this ground is... marked. Everything is one with the transmutated individual, the Mother... The animals that are born here, are changed, and immediately attack and eat their parents. The trees that are growing in cursed earth, absorbs every living thing that touches them and they feed the Mother with it.\nAnd as her root-web expands, so expands the whole forest.\n\nThe church later started to use the term \"Vampirism\" for getting overtaken by this nature.\n\nThe Mother then started giving birth to the last pieces of the chain that was supposed to allow human to evolve into the next stage...\nThere are two of them...\nWhen a tree does devour humans , it feeds itself and the Mother with their blood,There must be vampiric essence distributed into the body afterwards. Between the hunters it is told, that with their blood, their life force is also taken by the forest, from which the Ghosts manifests themselves. (Update note to the script) All Ghosts have vanished without trace a few decades ago. The cause of is phenomenom still unknown to us.\nThe humans are thrown out by the tree afterwards and awaken as an original Vampyr... they are able to endure a damage much more fatal than any human, before their body completely fails. And a Vampyr has a lot of other abilities, but on the other hand it suffers a complete loss of memory and personality. According to recent observations, its IQ drops to perhaps even lesser than animal level... and so this existence wanders through the night and does the one and only thing it was probably created for – spreading the Vampirism.\nOf all the creations of the Forest it is the only one capable of vampirising a human being...\nWhich of course becomes an undead, too. Develops an inability to survive on anything other than blood of the living beings. Even though it is not deadly to them yet, sensitiveness to the sunlight develops. And also the unexplained ability to read their surroundings – which all of the undead have – even despite of complete absense of light or even very eyeballs, like it is in the case of the ressurected skeletons. The newborn vampire can gradually develop other abilities and become more dificult to kill by normal means, but for that, they need the Number Two...\nAnd those are the only literal children of the Mother – Vampire Barons and Baronesses – extremely powerful vampiric beings, wearing a ragged red cape and reassembeling a frightenning mostrous cross-way between bat and human, with lightly blue skin and big red glowing eyes, created from Mothers own flesh and from her \"roots\" through the trees spread out into the Forest. (Update note to the script) This was only a theory, which nowdays seems likely to be misguided. It seems that the Barons are, in fact, strongly mutated vampyrs, probably advanced ones. However, a hypothesis of this kind is not easy to confirm, as it is very difficult and dangerous to observe the life-cycles inside of the Vampire Forests.\nThey are posessors of many extravagant vampiric powers, which a vampire can gradually also take advantage of  through a ritual in which they absorb so-called \"pure blood\" which they can get from Baron corpses. By that time, they cannot withstand the sunlight anymore. They can for example learn to summon a bat swarn as their cover and shield. That has a probable relation to Barons' ability to endlessly summon groups of child-looking vampiric creatures who are protecting them. (Update note to the script) It was reported that the Barons aross the world were not seen to use this ability for a long time. It is probable that they do no longer possess it. At the same time, it is said that their appearence has also changed to very human-like. That would imply a theory that, for some reason, their vampiric mutations are not as rapid as they once were. On the other hand, seemingly their subconsious desire for aristocratic cloth have taken even more intense measure. However, we are still not sure if they are are stealing the clothes somewhere, nor where they would even steal it. Some think that they grow them on their bodies. But this hypothesis is yet taken as... absurd. The ragged red capes was replaced by black velvets with gold lining. The Baronesses do wear heavy and wide dresses with rich drapery. But do not let that misguide you, they are still frighteningly fast and no less dangerous.\nA tale for scaring children seemingly later came from that. According to which, children, who shall not return to their homes before the dusk, will be found outside by a monster with red eyes, the Baron of the Night, and they will have to wander with him as his servants. When  children asked, why he would not come directly into their house and take them, parents explained  that he cannot enter ones' home without invitation. Unfortunately, this statement may be based on a lot, but not the truth. Yet Barons do not, for whichever reason, seem to occur anywhere outside the Vampire Forests.\nAlso, I have once heard something about some mad vampire lady and the \"altar of darkness\", but I consider it more of a strory to say when sitting by a campfire, than a real historical event.\n\nMany people of that time, as many people of today, believed, that this new form of human is superior to the \"old\" one, and should even be worshiped, since it will lead humanity forth to greatness and progress.\nHowever, it was happening that one of these superior humans, drunken by power, started to act absolutely recklessly towards their surroundings and the land was then full of changed animals, and villages were ending completely infested with vampirised villagers.\nVillagers, as we might know, are not exactly human and their origin is still covered with mystery. Thus their change is primitive, and just like the animals, they become a little stronger, blood-thirsty and helio-allergic. There are not many other benefits for them, so they are not exactly welcoming of it.\nLuckukly, there is a way to cure the villager vampirism, and that is by zombification; the zombie infection attacks the organism and always overpowers the vampiric essence. After it replaces it completely, all that is left to do is to initiate a standard treatment with a potion of weakness and a golden apple and the villager is cured. But, of course, the villagers' chance of survival of a zombie attack is... low. (Update note to the script) Zombies ceased to attack vampirised villagers. Many hunter experts are now trying to figure out how to exploit this effect to easily reverse turned lifestock and attacked villagers with the hightest percentual success rate possible.\n\nAnd so there were also those, who feared the Vampirism. The fact that it was the work of the witches, which were never exactly trusted, and that They could not withstand sunlight, which was considered a friend of all living and, how the church then believed, the look of the eye of the God itself, convinced them that it is an unnatural evil and must be destroyed. And if not that, then at least effectively suppressed.\nIt was decided that this should be accomplished by the science elite of that time – therefore the church. The research then must have been very frustrating, since the only universal weakness of vampires that was known, was the Sun, which could not be used very well in practice.\nThe development stopped here for some time. Furthermore, the majority of the church were villagers, which are not born to fight. So for the vampire hunt they tried to train and gear up humans with great temperament, who have not necessarily felt called to the God, but still had some kind of conviction. Actually after some time, the majority of humans, who did not become vampires, became their hunters. A lot of those brave people did never return from their journey, often they were turned  during their mission, without any way to regain their humanity back.\nExept one...\nOne of the first artifacts of the fight with the curse was so-called \"altar of cleansing\". The church declared it as \"a tool of Gods' mercy\" It represented an \"outcome\" for those vampires, who have grown disgusted of what they were now and were looking for a way out. The altar did not offer a return to the human life. But it was offering them a human death. In the moment when a vampire perished, it became human again, and thus did not have to automatically go right into damnation. That was the statement of the church, at least.\nThis method was often used by infected hunters, slowly but surely reducing the churches military force. However, I have heard that it is possible to survive through the \"cleansing\" with the help of a certain magical artifact... a totem, which the shamans from dark forests are supposed to make. It is said that a life of some of shamans' victims is trapped there. At the moment the holder of the totem dies, his life is replaced with a life trapped inside the totem, which breakst into pieces afterwards.\n\nBut then, of course, came the universal solution:  humans found another ultimate weakness of vampires... garlic.\nIt is not known how exactly this was discovered , but one popular (and quite amusing) tell-tale says that some hunter took a garlic bread for food on a hunting trip once. When he did fight a particular strong vampire, the vampire already started to push onto him in an attempt to sink her fangs into his neck. With the last strenght gathered, the hunter let out an echoing battle-cry, and unintentionally breathed into the face of his opponent. When she smelled the hunter’s garlic breath, she instantly fainted, rolled off him, and in addition to pain-filled howling and coughing, started to tap the ground around herself, disorientated. The hunter did not waste a second and in one strike, ended the vampire’s unlife. And thus, the investigation on the effect of garlic on Vampirism was started.\n\nI do not know how much truth is in this story. Afterall, I don’t think that simple garlic breath would force a vampire into such theatrical reaction, but in every tale, you have to expect some additional decorating, don’t you? Truthfully, it sounds more like some kind of a joke about how unpleasant garlic breath can be. However, this popular legend gave birth to a small hunter-tradition. Every proper hunter should have a small supply of garlic bread with them. By offering a piece of garlic bread to another hunter, one shows friendship and belonging towards them.\n\nAfter the discovery of the effects of garlic, a new wave of experiments came. The hunters went fighting with garlic on their bodies, but that did not prove itself to be an effective defence. The garlic could be ripped off during combat, it also didn’t have much of a particular effect on the vampires and so on… and so the infections continued and hunters were wandering to the altar of cleansing.\nResearch on garlic continued further. Clothes were drenched in its extract, later on  a special armor was developed, which was poisonous to the vampires on contact. It is also said that a large meal of garlic bread (or garlic itself, although rather unpleasant for consumption) can negate Sanguinare Vampiris while it is still active.\n\nAnd then, an idea was born… an idea, that probably the only way to prevent conversion, would be to get the garlic essence directly into human bloodstream. And that is where the alchemists have pointed their efforts. Casualities during these experiments were very high… I even think that a few cases of the Transmutation itself occured. When the experiments on lifestock and villagers were fruitless, focus moved more on the human part. The experiments were first performed on turned hunters, but that has proven ineffective.\nAnd finally, by means absolutely unknown to me (but probably at the cost of a lot of witchering and test subjects), they managed to create a new breed of garlic, which, later on,  supplanted the native one.\nInteresting about it is, that when compared to the native garlic, it has a lot less noticable unpleasant smell. The main benefit though is, that it is possible to create an extract from it, which can be harmlessly injected into ones blood.\n\nRelatively.\n\nIt is nothing fatal, only about an hour of fevers, poisoning and feeling of burning alive. I do not see throuh this matter entirely, and I do not want to assume, how the procedure works. But a Hunters that went through this infusion will no longer be able to host Sanguinare Vampiris inside their body, even if ten of Them would sink their teeth into their flesh. A human that goes through this procedure gains this immunity as well as increased physical strenght, which, with ongoing training, goes beyond human levels. I have heard that elite trained Hunters can throw a punch as strong as four normal miners, farmers or lumberjacks combined. Swinging around with large battle axes, so heavy that when they hit an enemy, it will knock them flying ten meters back. And this tool resting in hands that manipulate it so swiftly, like if it would only have a shred of its actual mass. Years and years and years of work and experiments to bring forth the answer to the new bloodssucking dangers embodied in this creation of brutal strenght and extermination. However, elite Hunters are extremely rare, as the vast majority finishes only basic training. They are often to be found camping in groups across the wilderness. (Update note on the script) More recent expert studies show hight probability of garlic irritating vampiric nature inside the human being. This mutual colision most likely causes large allergic reaction, and results in partial transmutation of the organism. Traces of garlic extract are repelled from the body shortly after. This in body reaction might be reason for the gained strength. This would suggest that Hunters actually activate the same vampiric nature that gives Vampires their strength, but in a different way.\n\nA path to previously unusable armory based on heavy weapons and heavy armor was thus opened to the Hunters now. They stopped dying poitlessly and their numbers were increasing again. Shortly after, they separated themself from the church and declared themselves an independent guild.\nHowever, even though the Hunter guild is not under the church anymore, not much really changed. System of disciple training was relatively independent already before. For the basic training you only had to find one of the numerous wandering or camping Hunters and pay them a certain amount of vampire blood. This ‘currency‘ is being quite commonly used as a payment for training. Not without a reason. It can be particulary useful among the Hunters as it can be used as a resource for some recipes. And in this case, it also shows the competence of the adept. If you are unable to survive through the night and gather blood from some low Vampyrs without dying or giving up, then there is no point wasting time and effort into training you, and you are better off dying or giving up.\n\nIf you want to go deeper into the secrets of a fight with a Vampire, you have to find elder professional hunters with advanced training, who live in some villages. They never abandon their home, since they suffer from permanent effects and damages from experimenting on their body with the brewery of blood potions. Or they just do not feel like hunting anymore. They are often very strong and resistent, but too slow for a work in terrain. At least those are the symptoms I have heard about.\nThus they live a residential life, passing their experience on the novices. If you would be interested, they can teach you some part of this potion brewery for example. Or other skills about Hunter alchemy and technology.\nFrom them you shall get the hightest education you can get for the work in this terrain.\n(Update note to the script) The blood potions are nowhere to be found nowdays. They were scrapped and their creation is no longer taught, as they were deemed ineffective during combat and too harmful towards the organism. They were replaced by the more recently discovered use of regular potions infused with dangerous and very potent ingredients, vampire blood including. The metabolism of a hunter can handle these without an issue and thus they are very useful in battle.\n\n\nI do not know everything about the vampiric breed, but let this knowledge I have gathered and rested on a paper guide you... and tell you the story about how the world drifted into even further uncertainty.\n"

        "Vampires have recently shown up in this area. They are disgusting creatures, surviving solely off of blood and human hearts. Even the creepers know to be afraid of them. I feel they suspect that they are not humans, instead something of an unnatural origin. Sadly, the vampires do not have this effect on zombies and skeletons, even appearing to have a friendly relationship with them. I fear that one day the dead will rise and I will lose this peaceful place I call home, but for now I will fight back with all I have."

        "§lCase study: transmutational mechanics of adepts for vampiric supression engagement§r\nFirst, there is a need to know what is so typical for a Vampire Hunter.\nWell, villagers living in hunter controlled villages have to frequently use injection of garlic serum, supplied by the Hunters in order to protect themselves from the convertion. That is why their blood is poisonous to vampires\nBut the Hunter - human Hunter- needs only one and is immune ever after. On the other hand, they need to use a chair with handcuffs, because the adepts will find themselves in crippling pain.\nThose who did study The Century of Evolution the old and relatively known chronicle, or have some advanced knowledge of the history, know the main difference between villagers and humans: all of humanity are (very inaccurately said) already vampires. Vampirism is like a chain, and the human doesn't stand only on its' end, but also on its' very start. Unlike villagers, whom do not have a trace of it in them, just like the animals don't.\nEverything possessing vampirism is allergic to garlic. Including human, if they have it direclty in their veins. It does not harm the organism, it harms the vampiric nature which is a part of every human being, waiting to turn it into the Mother. While Villagers suffer a minute of muscle discomfort, Hunter adept has to go through an hour of pain, fevers and symptoms of blood poisoning, bringing him literally to the edge of death.\nThat was some comparison, now back to the point of the theory: Why is one shot enough? There were a few theories on this topic of course, but as the time goes, we are coming to a better understandig of what we are actually dealing with.\nAccording to my observations, it is important to mention that Hunter blood is not poisonous to vampires, which clearly means that garlic is not present in the blood stream anymore afterwards. There is also an abnormal increase of strenght.\nBased on my research I conclude that the vampire potential is triggered by the garlic intoxication and will cause a massive allergic reaction. While getting rid of the garlic, it grows, influencing the anatomy. It does not turn the adept into a classic vampire from the end of the chain, it was not designed to do that. It was designed to turn him into a hideous giant pile of flesh...\nBut everything based on vampirism shares similar properties, and so the vampiric potential, when it gets better influence over the organism, is increasing strenght beyond human levels. But mainly, because of its' unusual extent in this state, it \"thinks\" that organism has already been vampirised, so it just ignores incoming vampire infections instead of fusing with them and creating another vampirised human.\nA side effect, not quite unfortunate by me, is that even when there is no need for blood, so there is none consumed, the organism does not know that, and is motivated to get some even when it's useless for it. This leads to an increased agression in a large percentage of human Hunters."
