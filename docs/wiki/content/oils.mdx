Oils are a unique way of improving weapons for a certain amount of time. They are a hunter exclusive feature.
They can be applied to tools, swords or armor depending on the oil type. All oils have a limited duration before the worn off and need to be applied again to receive its bonus.

## Crafting Oils

Oils are can be crafted by any hunter in the [Alchemy Tabel](./blocks#alchemy-table). The basic recipe for all oils require [Activated Oil](#activated-oil).

## Applying Oils

Once you have a crafted oil and an item on which you can apply the oil you can simply put them together in a crafting grid.

If you no longer want the oil on your item, or you are no hunter and want to remove the oil so that you can use the item. This can be done by combining the item with a [Paper](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Paper) in the crafting grid.
